In Javascript, variables don't have types, values do.
### primitive types in javascript
- undefined
- string
- number
- boolean
- object
- symbol
- null
- bigint(maybe future)
These are not called object
### some behavior associate with types
- undeclared?
- null?
- function? class
- array? object
- bigint? object
### undefined vs undeclared vs uninitialized (aka Temporal dead zone)
use new
- Object()
- Array()
- Function()
- Date()
- RegExp()
- Error()

Don't use new
- String()
- Number()
- Boolean()
